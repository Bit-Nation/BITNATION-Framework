# BITNATION framework

Welcome to the BITNATION framework!

The following is a framework to let you create nearly any kind of entity in the ethereum blockchain, example of such entities include:
 -  a Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN)
 -  a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
 -  a Union, like a Marriage or a Co-Living Agreement 
 -  a Holon, Embassy or a Consulate
 -  ... (put yours here :wink:)

The framework is created with smart contracts in Solidity. We dedicated a significant amount of work into making the contracts upgradeable, which is still quite rare in the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem.

 -  the following is based on the [Aragon codebase](https://github.com/Aragon/aragon-core) along with some modifications to represents our unique vision, in case of major changes we will submit a pull request to integrate our changes in the Aragon upstream project, thus leading to major open source cooperation.
